# Population-Income-group-UCI-Repo-dataset-
This repository contains data and Jupyter notebook of analysis on Income group dataset from UCI ML repository.

The Population-Income-group folder contains Jupyter notebook with datsets (Train and test).
I have used DecisionTree Classifier for the baseline model.

I have plans to improve this model,which I will do in sometime.
